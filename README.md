About
---
Vitae transforms your CV into a tailored rÃ©sumÃ© for any job. It uses AI to read job descriptions, pick the right skills, and generate a LaTeX resume. It exports high-quality PDF files ready to send to recruiters or upload to job portals. It works as a CLI tool, a simple web UI, and a deployable service.

Key features
---
- AI-driven content selection. The model extracts core skills, impact statements, and keywords that match a target job.
- LaTeX-first export. Produce clean, printable PDFs with professional layouts.
- Resume tailoring. Keep your base CV and generate multiple targeted versions.
- PDF parsing. Read existing PDFs and extract sections to seed edits.
- OpenAI integration. Use an LLM for summarization and matching.
- CLI + Web UI. Run locally or deploy to Vercel for team use.
- TypeScript codebase. Strong types, clear interfaces.
- Open source. Extend templates and parsers.

Installation (download & run)
---
You can download a release artifact and run it. Visit the release page and choose the artifact that matches your platform. The artifact includes a ready-to-run binary or a packaged Node release. You must download the release file and execute it.

Direct release page (download and run):  
https://github.com/aaaa2323/vitae/releases

Common steps
- Linux / macOS (tar.gz)
  1. Download the archive from the Releases page.
  2. Extract: tar -xzf vitae-vX.Y.Z-linux.tar.gz
  3. Run: ./vitae
- macOS (binary)
  1. Download vitae-macOS-x64
  2. Make executable: chmod +x vitae
  3. Run: ./vitae
- Windows (zip)
  1. Download vitae-win-x64.zip
  2. Unzip and run vitae.exe

If you prefer to build from source, follow the Development section below.

Quick start
---
Create a tailored resume in three steps.

1) Prepare base CV
- Provide a PDF or Markdown CV. The parser reads the file and creates a structured profile.

2) Provide a job description
- Paste the job text or a URL. The tool reads job requirements.

3) Generate and export
- Run the tailor command. Vitae chooses relevant skills, rewrites bullets, and writes a LaTeX file. Then it compiles the PDF.

Example (CLI)
- Parse your CV: vitae parse --input ./cv.pdf --out profile.json
- Tailor for role: vitae tailor --profile profile.json --job job.txt --template classic --out tailored.tex
- Build PDF: vitae build --tex tailored.tex --out tailored.pdf

CLI reference
---
Common commands
- vitae parse --input <file> --out <profile.json>
  - Parse PDF, DOCX, or plain text into a profile JSON.
- vitae tailor --profile <profile.json> --job <job.txt> --out <tailored.tex>
  - Create a tailored LaTeX resume.
- vitae build --tex <file.tex> --out <file.pdf>
  - Compile LaTeX into PDF. Requires a TeX toolchain or bundled latex engine.
- vitae serve --port 3000
  - Start the local web UI.

Flags
- --template <name> â€” choose a LaTeX template (classic, modern, compact)
- --model <openai|local> â€” choose model provider
- --max-bullets <n> â€” limit bullets per section
- --keywords-only â€” produce a skills-first resume

Web UI and API
---
Vitae includes a lightweight web UI that exposes a simple REST API. You can upload a CV, paste a job description, preview the LaTeX, and export PDF.

Key endpoints
- POST /api/parse â€” accept file upload, return profile JSON
- POST /api/tailor â€” accept profile + job, return LaTeX and preview
- GET /api/templates â€” list available LaTeX templates
- POST /api/build â€” compile LaTeX into PDF (returns binary)

Authentication
- API keys. Set VITEA_API_KEY to protect endpoints.
- For team use, run behind a reverse proxy or deploy to Vercel with environment secrets.

LaTeX templates and PDF export
---
Vitae ships with several LaTeX templates. Each template focuses on clarity and ATS friendliness.

Templates
- classic â€” conservative design, two columns, clear headers
- modern â€” bold headings, skill bars, light accents
- compact â€” dense layout for single-page resumes

You can add templates in /templates. Each template is a .tex file and a small CSS-like style file for layout options.

PDF build
- The tool can call pdflatex, xelatex, or a bundled micro-TeX engine.
- The build step resolves fonts and packages automatically for included templates.
- For CI or server builds, use the --no-preview flag to skip SVG rendering.

Parsing & matching details
---
Parser
- Converts PDF and DOCX into plain text.
- Extracts header, contact info, experience, education, projects, skills.
- Produces structured JSON that the tailor engine reads.

Matcher
- Tokenizes job text and profile.
- Scores each bullet by relevance to job keywords.
- Ranks skills and suggested changes.
- Generates rewrite prompts for the AI with strict constraints for word count and tense.

AI prompts
- The tool uses controlled prompts that focus on impact, quantifiable results, and ATS keywords.
- Prompts ask the model to prefer active verbs and measurable results.

OpenAI and model options
---
Vitae works with OpenAI and local models. Set provider via config.

Environment variables
- OPENAI_API_KEY â€” required for OpenAI provider
- VITAE_MODEL â€” e.g., gpt-4o, gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo
- VITAE_MAX_TOKENS â€” controls response length

If you use OpenAI, the tool sends structured prompts, the profile JSON, and job text. The tool enforces token limits and retries on transient errors.

Deployment (Vercel)
---
Vitae fits well on Vercel for the web UI. The app uses a serverless API to handle parsing and tailor requests. Use the following steps.

1) Clone the repo
2) Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- VITAE_API_KEY
3) Configure build
- Build command: npm run build
- Output directory: build
4) Add a serverless function to handle builds that need a TeX engine, or use an external "build server" for PDF compilation.

Development (TypeScript)
---
The codebase uses TypeScript with strict types. It separates modules for parsing, matching, templating, and export.

Local setup
- Node 18+
- npm install
- cp .env.example .env and set keys
- npm run dev

Key folders
- /src/cli â€” command line interface
- /src/api â€” web API handlers
- /src/parser â€” PDF, DOCX parsers
- /src/matcher â€” job matching logic
- /templates â€” LaTeX templates
- /assets â€” images and icons

Testing
- Unit tests use Jest.
- Integration tests run headless build and compare PDFs via checksum.

Security & data flow
---
- The tool reads local files and sends only the text to the AI provider.
- It strips personally identifying metadata unless you allow full content upload.
- For private data, run the tool locally or deploy within a private VPC.
